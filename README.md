# CODESIR
CODESIR contains a basic ODE SIR model and variations.

Python code for SIR models can be found in the folder SIR_model along with various plots. Files include: codeSIR.py, codesircombmixdisq.py, codeSIRdiscreteq.py

Python code for SIRS models can be found in the folder SIRS_model

Python code for SIRD models can be found in the folder SIRD_model

Python code for SIRDS models can be found in the folder SIRDS_model along with various plots. Files include: codesirec.py, codesirqformonb.py, codesirqint.py, codesirqrvar.py

Python code for SEIRDS can be found in the folder SEIRDS_model

Also included in CODESIR are Jupyter Notebooks for the SIR, SIRD, SIRDS, and SEIRDS models, and notebooks for versions of SIR, SIRDS, and SEIRDS with interactive sliders
